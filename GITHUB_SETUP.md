# GitHub Setup Instructions

Your local git repository has been initialized and the initial commit has been made!

## Steps to Push to GitHub:

### 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository with these settings:
- **Repository name**: `drone-checklist-generator` (or your preferred name)
- **Description**: "Standalone tool for generating customized drone operation checklists and procedure manuals"
- **Visibility**: Public (or Private if you prefer)
- **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Link your local repository to GitHub

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/drone-checklist-generator.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Alternative using SSH** (if you have SSH keys set up):
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/drone-checklist-generator.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify the upload

Go to your repository URL:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/drone-checklist-generator
```

You should see all your files there!

# Check status

.gitignore first, or create an `examples/` folder with sample outputs.
